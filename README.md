# tank
Project Tank is a Fully Enclosed FDM Printer constructed from a combination of 3030 extrusions.

This can be considered a fork of both the VORON2 and VORON24 Projects, with a fresh set of eyes trying some new things.

The goals of this project are as follows:
 - Fully Enclosed Design
 - Build Volumes of ~300^3 to 500^3 and beyond (use of whole plate available)
 - Direct Drive Extruder(s)
 - New, Innovative Belt Path, Self Squaring Axis'
 - Moving Gantry, not bed
 - MGN12 Rails (X, Y, Z)
 - Minimal Printed Parts
 - Combination of CF Nylon and ABS Printed Parts (Primary Nylon, Secondary ABS)
 - 9mm Belts on XY, 1204 Ballscrews on Z
 - 32 bit controller standard
 - 24V Power Standard

Edrawings will be posted as the design progresses, If you would like to follow along.
