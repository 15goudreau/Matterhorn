# tank
Project Tank is a Large Format, Fully Enclosed FDM Printer.

This can be considered a fork of both the VORON2 and VORON24 Projects, with a fresh set of eyes trying some new things. It is not in any way affiliated with VORON Design and is entirely a scratch design from a few of its engineering members.

 - New, Innovative Belt Path, Self Squaring Axis'
 - Moving Gantry, not bed
 - MGN12 Rails (X, Y, Z)
 - Heavy Duty Bearings
